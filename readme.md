### No but like really

crime, or custom runtime inter-media engine, is a web development framework based on others like react and svelte. it aims to provide a fast an intuitive developer experience and an easily extendable build.

### Cool features and whatnot (once it's done)

- Implicit reactive type
- Restorative state via IDB (or something)
- *Blazingly* fast ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
- Nice and familiar to use

### Stability

we are **not** stable. we literally have just started development on this, so maybe wait until at least the first beta release lol.
